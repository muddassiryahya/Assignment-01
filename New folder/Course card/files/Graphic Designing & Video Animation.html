    <h3>What is graphic design and animation?</h3>
    <p>While graphic design is more or less the art of communication and is mainly used to advertise content, animation
        on the other hand is used to show a story and entertain audiences. Graphic designing involves meeting with
        clients to produce logos or adverts that can be found in numerous media.</p>
