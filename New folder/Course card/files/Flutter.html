    <h3>Is Flutter a programming language?</h3>
    <p>Flutter is a mobile app development platform created by Google. It allows developers to create web, desktop, and
        cross-platform apps that run on Android and iOS devices. Flutter uses a reactive programming language called
        Dart, making development faster and easier than traditional methods.</p>
