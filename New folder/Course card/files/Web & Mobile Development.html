    <h3>What is web and mobile development?</h3>
    <p>
        As you might guess, mobile development is the process of creating applications that work on mobile devices
        running iOS or Android OS, and web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that
        work in web browsers. Both of these fields are always evolving.
