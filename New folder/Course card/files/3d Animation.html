    <h3>What is 3d Animation Videos?</h3>
    <p>The definition of 3D animation is, "Animating objects that appear in a three-dimensional space. They can be
        rotated and moved like real objects. 3D animation is at the heart of games and virtual reality, but it may also
        be used in presentation graphics to add flair to the visuals." </p>
